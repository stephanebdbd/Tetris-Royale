Reducing the Environmental Impact of Cities
Cities create a lot of waste and pollution. To protect people and nature, we need better waste management and cleaner air.

1. Waste Management (SDG 11.6.1)
Many cities collect and manage waste, but some do not. In 2021:

99% of waste was collected in Australia and New Zealand.
95% in Europe and North America.
Only 54% in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Some regions still have poor waste management, leading to pollution and health problems.
2. Air Pollution (SDG 11.6.2)
Many cities have dirty air because of cars, factories, and waste burning. This is dangerous for our health.

3. Solutions
To have cleaner cities, we need:

Better waste collection and recycling.
More public transport and green energy.
More trees and green spaces.
4. Conclusion
Cities must reduce waste and pollution. Governments and people must work together to protect the planet.
